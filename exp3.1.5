WAP using ternary operator, the user should input the length and breadth of a rectangle, one has to find out which rectangle has the highest perimeter. The minimum number of rectangles should be three.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n = 3; // minimum number of rectangles
    float length, breadth, perimeter;
    float max_perimeter = 0;
    int rect_num = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        printf("Enter length and breadth of rectangle %d: ", i);
        scanf("%f %f", &length, &breadth);

        perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth);

        // Update max perimeter using ternary operator
        max_perimeter = (perimeter > max_perimeter) ? perimeter : max_perimeter;
        rect_num = (perimeter > max_perimeter) ? i : rect_num;
    }

    printf("The rectangle with the highest perimeter has perimeter = %.2f\n", max_perimeter);

    return 0;
}
